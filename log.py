import time

'''

â€¢ The decorator should print the current time then afterwards print anything the is being decorated (see
examples below)
Hint: - Use time.ctime()

'''
def timestamp(some_func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        print(time.ctime())
        result = some_func(*args, **kwargs)   
        return result
    return wrapper
