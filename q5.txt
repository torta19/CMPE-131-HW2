1. Does the change inside increment_int_a change the variable a after the function call?

    no

2. Does the change inside increment_int_b change the variable b after the function call?

    yes

3. If they differ answer why? if not why not?
    Python passes objects by reference. The list is an object and therefore the items in the list can be 
    modified. On the other hand, primitive types are passed by value. Best way to modify by value is to use
    "return x".
